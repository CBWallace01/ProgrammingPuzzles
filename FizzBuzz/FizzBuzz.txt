FizzBuzz!

This is a classic for quickly determining the basic skill of a programmer. The task is simple:
Take an integer, n (> 0), as an input, and print every number from 1 to n.
The catch is that every number divisible by 3 should be replaced with "Fizz", and
every number divisible by 5 should be replaced with "Buzz". If a number is divisible by
both 3 and 5, it shall be listed as "FizzBuzz". EX:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
